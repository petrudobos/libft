# libft

**A library recoding standard libc functions, with a few extras.**

## Foreword

This is a programming assignment for first year students at Academy+Plus.

*Fillit is a project that lets you discover and/or familiarize yourself with a recurring problematic in programming: searching the optimal solution among a huge set of possibilities, in a respectable timing. In this particular project, you will have to find a way to assemble a given Tetriminos set altogether in the smallest possible square.*

*A Tetriminos is a 4-blocks geometric figure you probably already heard of, thanks to the popular game Tetris.*

More details included in the [fillit.en.pdf][1] file.
