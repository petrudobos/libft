# libft

**A library recoding standard libc functions, with a few extras.**

## Foreword

This is a programming assignment for first year students at Academy+Plus.

Recoding functions from the standard C library and other very useful functions while being limited by the use of only 3 basic utilities: malloc(3), free(3) and write(3).

## Contributing

Do report bugs, and raise issues and pull requests as you see fit. Improvements to make the code more concise/efficient/elegant are welcome. Thanks!

## Usage

Clone and open the directory, then 'make'.
Test the functions with your own main function and inputs.
