# libft

**A library recoding standard libc functions, with a few extras.**

## Foreword

This is a programming assignment for first year students at Academy+Plus.

Recoding functions from the standard C library and other very useful functions while being limited by the use of only 3 basic utilities: malloc(3), free(3) and write(3).

More details included in the [libft.en.pdf][1] file.
